                  "you hate February because it gives you a couple of days less to hug her, kiss her and tell her how much you love her.",
                  "you love her, not only for what she is but for what you are when you are with her. A hundred hearts would be too few to carry all your love for her.",
                  "if you live to be a hundred, you want her to live to be a hundred minus one day so you never have to live without her. 'You want her. All of her. Her flaws. Her mistakes. Her imperfections. You want her, and only her.'",
                  "you look at her and see the rest of your life in front of your eyes. Thinking of her keeps you awake. Dreaming of her keeps you asleep. Being with her keeps you alive.",
                  "every time you see her smile is a moment that makes all of the lifeâ€™s troubles worth tolerating. Just like how a burger meal is incomplete without chips and a drink, your day is incomplete if she doesn't give you those flirty winks",
                  "you love her, not only for what she is but for what you are when you are with her. A hundred hearts would be too few to carry all your love for her",
