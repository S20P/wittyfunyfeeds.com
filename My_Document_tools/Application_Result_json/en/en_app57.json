                  "He actively shaped his own  future. Not one to leave things to  the whimsies of fate, he strived  hard to create his own destiny.  Whatever he has now is the fruit of his wit and hard labor. He made himself his own person.",
                  "He has gone through one ordeal after another, but he never failed to get through them with his head held high. Failures don’t deter him from reaching his dreams— if anything, he uses them as motivation to do better next time.",
                  "He spares no effort when it comes to chasing after his dreams. Whenever he ventures out into something new, he gives his all. Not one to settle for half-assed things, he aims for nothing but perfection. His meticulous ways inspire others to be the same.",
                  "He has always looked for a greater meaning in life. For him, simply acquiring material belongings isn’t a measure of success. He dreams of something bigger— of changing the world. He is ready to pour all his love, blood, sweat, and tears to make the world a better place.",
                  "He never let the opinions of others get in his way. Though everyone was skeptical of his skills and talent, he proved them wrong with his hard work. He doesn’t let negativity get in the way of his road to success. He always ﬁnds the silver lining in the most difficult of situations.",
