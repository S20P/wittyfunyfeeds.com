                    spread, deep down there are scars that others
                    do not see. The fact she not only gets on with
                    her life but is always ready to help others is
                    truly incredible. A great girl.",

                  believes in taking chances and risking it all for
                  something she truly believes in. We need more
                  people like her, for the desires of her heart
                  create a ï¬‚ame that can ignite many other
                  beautiful minds. She is one of a kind.",

                    situation. No challenge frightens her despite all
                    she's been through over the years. She just
                    stands up straight and gets on with life.",

                  thinks and approaches challenges is truly an
                  inspiration. She always tries to spread a smile
                  even if there is a storm raging inside her. Truly

                  a head full of incredible advice. What people

                  battles and overcome many challenges to
                  become the person they see today.",

                  she'll protect them with terrifying ferocity.

                    attacks the problem and carries on with a grin
                    on her face. A real boss."
