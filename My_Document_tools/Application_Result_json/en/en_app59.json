                    "Be more honest - not only with others, but with yourself as well. You're not trying to help anyone by lying, you're only prolonging the inevitable. The truth will hurt at first, but it will also set you free.",
                    "Live a little more! Don’t let the fear of the unknown stop you from going on the best adventures of your life. Take a chance! The best things in life are outside your comfort zone.",
                    "Challenge yourself more! Life is a never-ending learning experience. Be more afraid of not trying than of failing. Doing things that you haven't done before is the only way for you to grow into the person that you want to be.",
                    "Have a grateful heart at all times. Instead of thinking about the things that you don‘t have, be thankful for the things that you do have. Show your loved ones that you appreciate them and everything that they do- it will make their day!",

    "Result_share":"It's hard at first, messy in the middle, but glorious at the end. Take the first step today!
                    Don't forget to share this result with your friends, and have yourselves an unrecognizable but beautiful year!",
